None of this code runs in its current state. These classes are just a few of many within an android app I have been solo developing for the purposes of continuing to learn Java, and app development.

I have chosen these classes as samples because I believe that together they provide a good representation on my current skill level with object-oriented programming.

I am aware that the samples I am providing in no way show perfect code, as that is not the intention. It shows the code of an individual that is taking additional time outside of required coursework to continue to develop their skills on a more involved and engaging project.

-----------------------------------------

The classes displayed show a piece of the upgrades system I am implementing in my game, similar to the talent system in many RPGs. The recommended viewing order is below:

1. Upgrade - Base Class for Upgrades to hold the data of each individual upgrade.
2. All_Upgrades - Creation of each upgrade
3. UpgradesCardAdapter - Class which acts as an adapter between the Upgrade backend and the UI
4. UpgradesWarriorFragment - Controls the display of the Upgrades
5. Player - Holds and allows functions specific to the player. Some, but not all of the implementation of each upgrade can be seen within the functions of this class

Thanks for your time!
